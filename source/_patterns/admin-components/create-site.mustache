{{!     Create Site
        ---------------
        Allows the user to create a new website. This is a multi-step process that includes 
        - picking a board to sync with 
        - confrming site's name and initial domain name.

        We'll keep all this in a single component and use Javascript to progressively reveal the steps.

        TODO: 
        - Add the rest of the markupâ€”formify this. 
        - Add some fancy JS to progressively reveal each section of the form so it's usable. (Later)
 }}

<h1>Create New Site</h1>
<h2>Your Trello Boards</h2>
<p>Your Trellofolio will automatically stay in sync with the board to which you connect.</p>
